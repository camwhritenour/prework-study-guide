# Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created a webpage so that I could simultaneously learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also creating a space to organize what I have learned.

## Usage

This webpage showcases different sections of material I learned about while working on this project. It provides a clean and convenient way for me to not only access my past notes, but continue to build on it as I progess.

There are also functions you can access through the console. You can access this by using the ChromeDevTools by pressing Command+Option+I or Control+Shift+I on windows, then navigating to the console window on the top. In the console you will see a list of the topics I learned from along with a suggestion on which topic to study.
